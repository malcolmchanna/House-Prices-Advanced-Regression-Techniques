<h1>House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques</h1>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>Welcome to the House Prices prediction project! The main aim of this project is to predict house prices based on various features using advanced regression techniques. The project is divided into three exciting phases: Data Analysis, Feature Engineering, and Feature Selection.</p>

<h2> Dataset</h2>
<p>The dataset for this project can be downloaded from the Kaggle competition: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data">House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques</a>.</p>

<h2>PHASE-1: Data Analysis </h2>
<p>In this phase, we dive deep into the data to gain valuable insights. The steps involved are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Data Exploration</strong>: Load the dataset and explore its shape and contents.</li>
  <li><strong>Missing Values Analysis</strong>: Analyze missing values and their relationship with the target variable.</li>
  <li><strong>Numerical Variables Exploration</strong>: Examine numerical, temporal, discrete, and continuous variables.</li>
  <li><strong>Numerical Relationships</strong>: Visualize the relationships between numerical variables and the target variable.</li>
  <li><strong>Outliers Detection</strong>: Identify and visualize outliers in continuous variables.</li>
  <li><strong>Categorical Variables Analysis</strong>: Explore categorical variables and their impact on the target variable.</li>
</ul>

<h2>PHASE-2: Feature Engineering </h2>
<p>In this phase, we enhance the data for model building. The steps involved are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Handling Missing Values</strong>: Replace missing values in categorical variables with a new label 'missing', and in numerical variables with the median.</li>
  <li><strong>Temporal Transformation</strong>: Convert temporal variables to represent the difference between 'YrSold' and their respective years.</li>
  <li><strong>Numerical Transformation</strong>: Apply log normal distribution to handle skewness in numerical variables.</li>
  <li><strong>Handling Rare Labels</strong>: Combine rare labels in categorical variables into a new label 'Rare_var'.</li>
  <li><strong>Label Encoding</strong>: Encode categorical variables based on their relationship with the target variable.</li>
  <li><strong>Numerical Scaling</strong>: Scale numerical variables using Min-Max scaling to bring them to the same range.</li>
</ul>

<h2>PHASE-3: Feature Selection </h2>
<p>In this phase, we select the most important features for our model. The steps involved are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Feature Selection Model</strong>: Use the Lasso regression model for feature selection, with a suitable alpha (penalty) value.</li>
  <li><strong>Important Features</strong>: Print the selected features and some statistics.</li>
  <li><strong>Update Training Dataset</strong>: Update the training dataset to include only the selected features.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Model Building and Evaluation </h2>
<p>The provided code summary does not include the complete model building and evaluation steps, which are essential for making accurate predictions on new data. It is recommended to include these steps to complete the project.</p>

<h2>Requirements </h2>
<p>To execute the provided code successfully, ensure that you have the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Python environment with required libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn).</li>
  <li>The dataset downloaded from the Kaggle link provided above.</li>
</ul>
